# Drug-Prediction
Objective: To develop predictive models for assessing treatment responses and 
survival outcomes in patients with cirrhosis, enabling healthcare providers to make 
informed clinical decisions and improve patient management. 
• Scope of Work:   
• Collect and preprocess patient data, including clinical features, laboratory 
results, and treatment history. 
• Develop and validate predictive models using machine learning techniques to 
categorize patient outcomes. 
• Analyze and interpret model results to provide actionable insights for 
healthcare professionals. 
• Create a user-friendly visualization dashboard to present predictions and 
assist in treatment planning. 
• Expected Outcomes:  
• Accurate predictive models for identifying treatment responses and survival 
probabilities in cirrhosis patients. 
• Improved decision-making in clinical settings based on data-driven insights. 
• A comprehensive report detailing model performance, clinical implications, 
and future recommendations for patient care.
